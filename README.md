Make sure all the files are in the same directory when you run.  
clean.py: processes and cleans data.  
firePCA.py: implements PCA to return a reduced features matrix to use for supervised modeling.  
WildfirePCA.py: implements PCA for the purpose of obtaining useful statistics on the PCA dimensionality reduction.  
NaiveBayes.py: implementes Naive Bayes supervised learning method for predictive classificaiton on wildfire susceptibility levels (imports clean.py and firePCA.py).  
regression.ipynb: implements linear regression and logistic regression for predicting the number of wildfires and predicting the classification on wildfire susceptibility levels, respectively.
